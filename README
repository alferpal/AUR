ArchLinux User Repository packages maintained by me (AUR user: ethail):

For now, I maintain:

baobab
thunderbird-firetray-git
firefox-firetray-git

Any trouble or problem with them, you can post a comment at the AUR package page at aur.archlinux.org or send me a mail. Forum posts are also useful but less easy for me to be seen.
